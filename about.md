Hi, I'm Gustavo Leon. You may remember me from such amazing projects as [gmaps](https://hpneo.dev/gmaps "gmaps.js: Google Maps API with less pain and more fun"), CodePicnic or [Runa](https://runahr.com "Payroll and HR software for SMB").

I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in JavaScript and Ruby. I have 10 years of experience working with projects in different industries, from digital campaigns to HR, e-commerce and SaaS products.
